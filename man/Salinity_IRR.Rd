\title{Analysis of salinity data against IRR standards}
\usage{
Salinity_IRR(Chem_table, DU_table)
}
\arguments{
\item{Chem_table}{Compiled water chemistry data from Data_Prep function. Usually
contains a combination of grab, LTD, and lake profile data.}

\item{DU_table}{Quality controlled Stations DU table from Data_Prep function.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing analyzed salinity data compared to IRR
water quality criteria.
}
\description{
This function compares salinity data against water quality
standards for irrigation (IRR) use. For more information, see the NMED
Consolidated Assessment and Listing Methodology (CALM) guidance manual.
